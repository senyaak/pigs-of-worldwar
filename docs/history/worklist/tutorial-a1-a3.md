# A. THE TUTORIAL — finish the training ground

*A closed entry of the old work list, moved here whole on 2026-11-02. What is still open from it lives in [docs/todo.md](../../todo.md).*

The script MOVES now: a crate collected speaks, a crate PLACED speaks, and the
menu counts (docs/history/training.md, "THE TRAINING SCRIPT MOVES"). The END
of it is built too
(A1, done). What is left is one line and the camera.

**And it can be JUMPED to a step** — F12 on, F11 back, `pow.step(9)` for the
bazooka (`lib/game/training.ts`, docs/history/training.md, README). Anything below that says
"play the tutorial to the TNT" is a keypress now.

## A1. Killing the last dummy must END the mission — DONE 2026-08-11

Play: "убить последний манекен — не заканчивает миссию… очевидно что заканчивает
миссию." Read end to end and built; `lib/game/endOfGame.ts` is the rule and
`tutorial/notes.md` + `turns/notes.md` the derivation.

**Nothing watches for a win frame by frame.** `Game::NextTurn` (0x48F490) asks
0x4966A0 for the state of the game before it advances anybody, so a mission ends
at the HANDOVER and never before — the dummy comes apart, its crate lands, the
beat at the end of the turn runs, and only then does anyone notice there is
nothing left to break. That timing is kept.

**What the training branch counts**: the object list, for a breakable (body type
0x135A) whose `[obj+0x84]` is `0x43..0x47` or `0x4B`. That field is the name
table's index **minus 0x1C** (written at 0x48D076), so the six kinds are TARGET,
TARGET2..5 and **DUMMY** — and pointedly not `T_SUP`/`T_SUP2`/`T_SUP3`, the
stands they are mounted on, though all nine share the one-point health row. CAMP
carries eleven DUMMY records and none of the TARGET family. The test never looks
at the placed flag, so the eight the script holds back count as standing from
load. A training level cannot be LOST, either — the branch has no such answer.

**The ending itself is mode 2, END OF GAME**: the clock stops, nothing is driven,
the camera walks the survivors one every two seconds (`0x490EFF` stamps `+0x4BC`
forward by exactly 0xC8), and past **three seconds** any key — or **twenty** on
its own — puts the battle away (mode 18, QUIT). The sergeant signs off with clip
**27** if it took more than twelve turns and **28** otherwise (`[+0x40C]`, the
handover count).

**Two of the four "closers" turned out to be nothing of the kind**, and the
todo's own premise was wrong about them. Both are BUILT now:

- clip **21** is the first MINE going off — its call site is the projectile
  constructor, gated on ammo rows 0x28/0x29 (the two `WE_APMIN`), so it answers a
  mine trodden on or hit by something thrown alike. Its flag `[+0x330]` is the
  other way up from what it looks: the game object is built with it SET, each of
  the two MINEFIELD crates CLEARS it as it speaks its own line (0x465D72,
  0x465DBD — the health×15 and ×20 arms), and speaking sets it back. **Once per
  minefield, and only after being told to walk into one.**
- clip **26** is a turn whose clock ran out with **no weapon used**. `[+0x334]`
  is incremented by the fire dispatcher, zeroed at each handover but only from 1
  or less, and the line writes **2** — the one value the reset refuses, so it is
  once a level.

`armsMineLine`/`MINE_LINE`/`WASTED_TURN_LINE` in `lib/game/tutorial.ts`,
`weaponUses` in `lib/game/battle.ts`, and the `turnWasted` event. One half of the
exe's guard is not modelled and says so at the field: it drops the wasted-turn
line while the sergeant is talking and lets it come round later, where the remake
counts it said.

**What is NOT pinned**: the honest eleven-dummy path. `e2e/000/engine-headless.spec.ts`
drives the whole seam — handover, ending, the three-second hold, the battle being
put away — on a CAMP built with its DUMMY records left off, because reaching the
condition legitimately is the entire tutorial. `e2e/002/endOfGame.spec.ts` pins
the data around it.

## A2. Clip 4 — the last line of the script — DONE 2026-08-11

"PRESS SPACE TO SELECT YOUR WEAPON", and the field it hung on was the MENU: the
game object's first 0x300 bytes ARE the skill menu, sixty-four cells of twelve
(skill, amount, a 1-or-2 flag). `0x492FD0` clears the block in one 4×16 loop and
`0x468BD0` fills it from the pig's own list — which is why the same
`mov eax,[esi]` two instructions earlier decides whether the cursor is put back:
an empty first cell is an empty menu. So `[gameMode+0] == 3` is **the bayonet
sitting in the first cell**, and the line is "the menu has just been opened, the
counter is still at nought, and the first thing in it is the bayonet".

`clipForMenu` in `lib/game/tutorial.ts`, the `menuOpened` event carries the first
cell, and `e2e/002/tutorial.spec.ts` now hears 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 in order on the real
map. All 28 clips of the script now have something that fires them except the two
that were never closers — clip 21, the first mine, and clip 26, a turn spent
doing nothing (both read, neither built).

## A3. The camera looks the pig in the FACE under the canopy — ALREADY BUILT

The entry was stale. `three/chase.ts` has the view (`FACE_LIFT`, and `watch`
picks `'face'` while `underCanopy` is up) — the chase rig turned around, level
with the pig rather than over its shoulder. What is true is the disasm note's own
sentence: **nothing in the exe has been traced for it**, so the framing is the
remake's own and play is what corrects it.
