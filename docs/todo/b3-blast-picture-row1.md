# B3. Read ALL of the blast's picture, not half

Play: "не правильный эффект при взрыве… половина прочитана — читай всё."

**Read already.** The destructor's per-kind table (0x435A6C) sends kind 10 to
`0x433220`, which joins the tail at `0x43533E` and pushes effect **0x53** where
the grenade's arm pushes 0x54; both play sound 0x0C (`E_1`). The id → row map
resolves 0x53 to **parameter ROW 1** (`byte [0x489680 + id − 1]` → slot 54 → arm
`0x488faa` → `0x48ccc0(1)`), against the grenade's row 0.

**Read now — 2026-08-11.** Row 1 is transcribed and stages D and E are decoded
(`effects/notes.md`): a near-black 70-sprite cloud, a **five-way fan of grey
smoke JETS** at 200 a frame (stage D — fifty frames a jet), and two bursts.
Stage E turned out to be enabled in no row at all. What is left is only the
build: add row 1 to `lib/game/effects.ts` beside `ROW_ZERO` and `MINE_EFFECT`
(the jet fan needs its stage-D shape drawn), and `Charge` has to carry the
effect id the way the mine's already does.
