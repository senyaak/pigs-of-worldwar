# B7. A pig thrown by a blast SPINS about its own axis

"Летящая свинья вроде ещё крутится вокруг своей оси." **Both first guesses are
measured out**: not the draw path (`heading` reaches the picture from one place
and nothing writes it from a velocity), and not the clip (BOUNCE is clip 39,
twenty frames, bone 0 does not move at all and its root track has a y span of
zero). What is left unexamined is the wall EJECT — `state.heading =
query.downhill(...) ?? state.heading + π` in `locomotion.ts`, which a pig landing
wedged runs every 25 frames.
