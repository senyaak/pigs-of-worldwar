# Pigs of Worldwar — orientation

A fan remake of Gremlin's *Hogs of War* (2000) in Electron + Three.js +
TypeScript. It reads assets straight out of a legally installed copy; nothing
from the original is redistributed. This repo normally sits **inside** the
game folder, so `..` is the installation.

Start with [README.md](README.md) (how to play and run), then
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) and [docs/formats.md](docs/formats.md).
Reverse-engineering findings live in a separate repo next door,
[`../pigs-disasm`](../pigs-disasm) — notes plus the scripts that prove them.

## Traps that cost real time — do not rediscover these

**Two coordinate systems, and they disagree.** Models (VTX) are **Y-down**.
PMG terrain heights are **elevation, up-positive** — the opposite. The whole
map rendered upside-down for several commits, coherently enough that
auto-framed screenshots hid it; water sitting at the *small* height values is
what gave it away. Everything in the engine works in the game's Y-down space
and converts once, at the top, with a 180° X-rotation on a wrapping group —
never `scale.y = -1`, which mirrors handedness and breaks winding and
animation.

**MCAP rotations**: `local = Rx(-x) · Ry(-y) · Rz(-z)`, parent-relative,
XYZ order. how-doc calls them quaternions; they are not. The negation is the
subtle part — the game's matrices are row-major, the transpose of three's.
Legs look fine either way (their bind direction is already down), so **only
the arms reveal a sign error**. Full derivation with three proof scripts:
`../pigs-disasm/anim/notes.md`.

**The model faces +X**, hence `PIG_HEADING_OFFSET = -π/2`.

**`HEIGHT_SCALE` is the one vertical knob, and it is 1 against the exe.**
The exe doubles the PMG heights in three places — collision sampler,
`afAdjustMapHeights` in `_d3d.dll`, the map's own bounds — and its loader
copies them in untouched, all verified. But a doubled CAMP plays as a
mountain range and reads as stretched next to the original, so the remaster
renders 1×. Do not "fix" this back from the disassembly alone; the
contradiction is written up in `../pigs-disasm/movement/notes.md` and wants
whatever undoes the doubling to be found first. Vertical constants lifted
from the exe go through `fromExeY`, so they follow the knob.

**Nothing about the ground refuses a step.** Not its height, not the wall
flag. The exe pins a pig to the landscape however steep, and a wall is not a
blocker at all: the landscape collider (`0x415590`) swaps the ground's
material for friction 0.01 / restitution 0.99 wherever `Map::IsBlocked` says
yes, and the pig is thrown about by an almost perfectly elastic floor until
the wedge counter ejects it. Only the world limit refuses, and only empty
air under the feet changes the outcome. Refusing at a wall was tried here
and it walled pigs IN on top of cliffs — a cliff lip is a wall tile too.

**The ground carries its own light, and the engine must not add one.** Each
PMG vertex stores a brightness byte (how-doc: "unknown ≤255") that the
original modulates the tile texture by, Gouraud across the triangle — which
is the whole reason its hills look rounded rather than faceted. It fits a
light pointing straight up with almost no ambient (ARCHI R² 0.81), and
neighbouring blocks store the same value on the vertices they share, so the
gradient is continuous over the whole map. `three/terrain.ts` draws it unlit,
texture × shade, with the shade converted to linear first; lighting those
polygons again — especially with the per-face normals `computeVertexNormals`
gives split vertices — is exactly the faceting it replaces.

**`MapTileSlip` is not slip** — it is which half or diagonal of a wall tile
is solid, read by `Map::IsBlocked` and by nothing else.

**A tile is two triangles, not a bilinear patch**, split along
(col+1,row)-(col,row+1) — the same diagonal the mesh uses, so collision and
visuals are the same surface. `TerrainQuery.patch` returns that plane, which
is also what gives an exact slide direction; differencing across the crease
gives a direction that is downhill on neither side.

**The animation library is `Data/_d3d.dll`**, not the exe — the exe resolves
`afDrawAnimModel` and friends via `GetProcAddress`. Hunting skeletal maths in
`warhogs_.exe` is a dead end (recorded in the notes).

**Clip indices come from the exe's own name table**, not guesswork:
0 run, 3 walk back, 4 turn on spot, 5 swim, 8-10 jump, 11 scramble,
27/28 idle, 47-50 dying/drowning. See `../pigs-disasm/animations/notes.md`.

## How the code is laid out

- `src/lib/formats/` — one pure reader per format (mad, tim, mgl, bmp, model,
  hir, mcap, pmg, ptg). No fs, no Electron, no three: they take bytes.
- `src/lib/game/` — the rules (`Game`, `TerrainQuery`, `movement`,
  `ballistics`). Pure too, so the domain specs drive them directly.
- `src/main/` — `index.ts` lifecycle only, `gameDir.ts` locating the install,
  `assets.ts` loading through the readers, `ipc.ts` the IPC surface.
- `src/renderer/src/` — `ui/` one module per view, `three/` scene/pig/terrain/
  battle/clips, `input/` the controller. `main.ts` is composition only.

Keep modules small and single-purpose; that split was an explicit request.

## Input goes through the controller — including tests

`src/renderer/src/input/controller.ts` names what a player can do
(`walkForward`, `turnLeft`, `jump`, `endTurn`). Keys, on-screen buttons and
the e2e suite all call the same `press`/`release`/`tap`. **Never synthesise
key events in a spec** — that tests a parallel path, and a broken keybinding
would still pass. Use `e2e/controller.ts`.

## Tests

Phases are folders: `e2e/000/` foundation (formats, viewers), `e2e/001/` the
menu, `e2e/002/` the battle. Serial, one worker; within a folder files run
alphabetically, so the spec that creates the phase's state sorts first.
Unnumbered specs at the root are standalone.

Fail fast: no sleeps, no raised timeouts. Every launch goes through
`e2e/launch.ts`, which collects renderer errors, `console.error` and process
output *before* the bundle runs; specs assert `expect(errors).toEqual([])`.
A dead renderer keeps its markup, so assertions on markup alone can pass
happily — the error array is what tells the difference.

**One app for the whole run.** `e2e/app.ts` is a worker-scoped fixture: take
`{ app }` and you get a page already back on the menu, plus `app.errors()`
scoped to your spec. Leave the app on a screen `toMenu` can exit from. Only
specs whose subject IS starting or stopping — cold start, warm start,
fullscreen, Exit, closing the window, `--game-dir` — call `launchApp`
themselves. Worker fixtures make Playwright group the specs that use them,
so the phase order no longer holds across the whole run; nothing depends on
it beyond `PHASE_ENV` existing, and the fixture says so if it does not.

Specs run against the **real** installation, read-only, with counts asserted
as floors where savegame churn could move them and exactly where it cannot.

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run build && npx playwright test
```

## Where it stands

Formats, models, textures, skeleton, 93 animations and terrain all parse and
render. The menu wears the original art. The battle scene puts two squads on
CAMP with the original's turn clock, tank controls, jumping, swimming, and
ground movement taken from the exe — see `../pigs-disasm/movement/notes.md`
for the derivation of every constant in `src/lib/game/movement.ts` and
`src/lib/game/ballistics.ts`.

What the exe gave up, in short: nothing about the ground refuses a step; a
wall is a 0.01/0.99 surface that shakes a pig loose, and a pig inside one
never lands; each terrain type carries its own friction and restitution, and
type 11 is the one that plays the Scramble clip; a landing is binary at an
impact of 25 a frame; a jump is committed, forward, and costs 15 frames.

### Known divergences — deliberate, and each written up where it lives

- **`HEIGHT_SCALE` is 1** though the exe doubles. See above.
- **Contact softening is not modelled.** The original lets a body penetrate
  and pushes it out by a decaying bias (0.2 → 0.02); a landing here pins to
  the ground height, so there is nothing to decay. `BOUNCE_CUTOFF` stands in.
- **Gravity, walk speed and turn rate are still hand-tuned.** The originals
  are behind `warhogs_.exe` 0x4707f0 and the pig-class table the block copy
  at 0x466de9 fills.

### Threads left mid-pull

- `0x406bb0`, 3280 bytes: the collision test itself. Knowing what else lives
  in that world would settle whether objects need their own handling.
- The flag at `+0x3a4` is a bitfield; only bit 3 (terrain type 11) is traced,
  and six other sites write it.
- The tile type's low 5 bits: 0x20 water, 0x80 wall and the twelve material
  rows are known; the rest of the meanings are not.
